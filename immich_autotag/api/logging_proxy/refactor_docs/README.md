# Logging Proxy Refactor Documentation

This folder contains documentation and planning for the refactor of file and function names in the `logging_proxy` package.

## Goals
- Establish a clear, consistent naming scheme for files and functions.
- Align file names with API entrypoints (as shown in the web documentation and library).
- Decide whether to use API names directly or add a prefix.
- Document all changes for traceability.

## Next Steps
1. List all current filenames and their functions.
2. Map each to its proposed new name.
3. Reference API documentation for naming alignment.
4. Decide on prefixing or direct API names.

Further documents in this folder will detail the mapping and decisions.
