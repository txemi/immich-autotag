# Immich Proxy Refactor Documentation

This folder contains documentation and planning for the refactor of file and function names in the `immich_proxy` package.

## Goals
- Establish a clear, consistent naming scheme for files and functions.
- Align file names with the Immich API entrypoints (as shown in the web documentation and client library).
- Make the structure predictable and maintainable.
- Document all changes for traceability.

## Next Steps
1. List all current filenames and their functions.
2. Map each to its proposed new name, aiming for symmetry with the API client package.
3. Reference API documentation for naming alignment.
4. Decide on prefixing or direct API names if needed.

Further documents in this folder will detail the mapping and decisions.
