"""
Subpackage for Immich link parsing utilities.

This package provides functions to extract identifiers (UUIDs) from Immich links, distinguishing between album and asset (photo) IDs, and enabling their use in classification and filtering logic.

The goal is to centralize and improve the parsing logic for Immich URLs, allowing for future extensibility and easier maintenance.
