# Immich AutoTag – Explain Like I'm 5

Imagine you have hundreds of thousands of photos from many years, different phones, computers, and old folders. Some are important memories, some are just memes or random images, and everything is mixed up. Over time, you lost track of what’s organized and what’s not. Some photos aren’t in any album, some have the wrong date, and some are duplicates.

**What does Immich AutoTag do?**

- **Finds what’s not organized:** It scans all your photos and tells you which ones are not in any album or don’t have the right tags. These are the photos that still need your attention.
- **Highlights problems:** If a photo is in two places it shouldn’t be (like in a family album and also tagged as a meme), it marks it as a “conflict” so you can fix it.
- **Helps with memes and unimportant stuff:** You can tag memes or less important photos, so they don’t clutter your main albums. The tool helps you keep these out of the way.
- **Fixes dates:** If a photo has the wrong date (for example, because it was sent by WhatsApp or copied from another device), Immich AutoTag can often figure out the real date from the filename or other clues and fix it for you.
- **Uses your rules:** By default, it assumes albums that start with a date are already organized, but you can change the rules to fit your style.
- **Works with duplicates:** If you organize or tag one copy of a photo, Immich AutoTag can automatically tag all its duplicates or add them to an album, saving you lots of time.
- **Creates albums from old folders:** If you used to organize photos in folders, it can turn those folders into albums in Immich.
- **Easy to review:** After each run, you can click on special tags in Immich to see only the photos that need organizing or have conflicts.

**How does it help you?**

- Every time you run Immich AutoTag, your photo library gets a little more organized.
- Over time, the number of “unclassified” or “conflict” photos goes down.
- Eventually, your whole library is tidy, and keeping it organized becomes easy.

**In short:**  
Immich AutoTag is like a smart helper that finds the mess in your photo collection, helps you clean it up, and keeps everything organized with much less effort.

This is powered by a rule engine that is designed to become more abstract and flexible over time, so users can adapt it to their own needs. By default, it comes with a configuration that should work well for most common scenarios.
