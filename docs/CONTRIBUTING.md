# Contributing to Immich AutoTag

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Immich AutoTag! This project is developed in spare time and all contributions are welcome.

## How to Contribute
- **Bug fixes, documentation improvements, and feature suggestions** are always appreciated.
- The area with the highest impact right now is fixing and re-enabling GitHub Actions (CI/CD). Currently, GitHub Actions are disabled due to the challenge of embedding the Immich client library in the build process. If you can help resolve this, your contribution would be especially valuable! You can join the discussion or contribute directly in [Issue #32](https://github.com/txemi/immich-autotag/issues/32).
- If you have ideas for new features, improvements, or want to help with code, feel free to open a pull request or issue.

## Guidelines
- Please follow the existing code style and structure as much as possible.
- For major changes, open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
- Make sure to test your changes before submitting a pull request.

## Getting Started
- See the [Developer Guide](./development.md) for technical details and project structure.
- If you have questions, open an issue or start a discussion on GitHub.

## Publishing
- The publication of the Python library to public repositories works when using the local scripts.
- However, automated publishing via GitHub Actions is not yet functional. Any help with enabling or fixing this CI/CD workflow would be especially valuable!
