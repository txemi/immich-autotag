All Docker usage (one-shot, cron, docker-compose, images) is documented in the main `README.md` under the **Docker** section. To avoid drift, this page is kept as a pointer only.

- One-shot public image: `bash scripts/docker/run_docker_public.sh`
- One-shot configurable image: `bash scripts/docker/run_docker_with_config.sh [--image txemi/immich-autotag:latest]`
- Cron image / compose examples: see `README.md` and `docker/docker-compose.yml`.
