## Brief description of the initial implementation

An initial implementation was carried out that worked well and aimed to survive or fix the existence of duplicate albums. This issue became especially evident when we started creating maps that retrieve an album by its name, which made the appearance of duplicates clear.

To address this, the system attempted to resolve duplicates either by merging the albums or by renaming one of them. There were several approaches, but currently we do not have much more documentation about the process.

If we find additional documentation related to this topic, this will be the place where all relevant information will be relocated.
