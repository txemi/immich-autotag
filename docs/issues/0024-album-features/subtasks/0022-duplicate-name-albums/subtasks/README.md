# Duplicate Album Name Subtasks

## Why Subtasks?

This functionality has been separated into subtasks because there have been multiple implementations and approaches over time. By organizing the work into distinct subtasks, we can revisit, review, and improve this feature as needed. This structure helps maintain clarity and order in the sequence of actions, making it easier to track changes, understand the evolution of the solution, and ensure robust management of duplicate album names.
