# Duplicate Album Name Management

## Objective

The goal of this feature is to ensure the integrity and consistency of album names within the application. Duplicate album names can cause confusion, data corruption, and unpredictable behavior in the product. By detecting, cleaning, and preventing duplicate album names, we maintain a reliable user experience and protect the database from contamination. This management process includes maintenance routines, robust detection logic, and fail-fast mechanisms to avoid further issues and keep the album collection clean and well-organized.
