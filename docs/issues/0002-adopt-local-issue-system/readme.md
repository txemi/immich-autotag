# 0002 - Adopt Local Issue System

**Tech Stack:** #Git #PlainText #LLM #Python #Documentation

## Context
We are migrating to a local-first, plain-text issue tracking system. This issue tracks the adoption process, including moving existing documentation to the new structure, updating references, and ensuring all features/tasks are properly linked to their issue folders.

## Definition of Done (DoD)
- [ ] All relevant docs in `docs/` reviewed and classified
- [ ] Feature/task-specific docs moved to their corresponding issue folders
- [ ] Obsolete or generic docs archived or left in place
- [ ] CHANGELOG and ROADMAP updated with links to issues
- [ ] Registry and issue folders updated
- [ ] Migration plan documented in this issue
