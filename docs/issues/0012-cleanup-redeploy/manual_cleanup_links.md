# Manual Cleanup: Public Registries

To quickly delete all old images and versions from public registries, access the following links and manually remove obsolete resources. Have your access credentials ready.

## Docker Hub
- [txemi/immich-autotag (Docker Hub)](https://hub.docker.com/r/txemi/immich-autotag/tags)
  - Delete old and unwanted tags from the "Tags" tab.

## PyPI
- [immich-autotag (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/immich-autotag/#history)
  - Click on the version to delete and use the "Delete" option if available.

## TestPyPI
- [immich-autotag (TestPyPI)](https://test.pypi.org/project/immich-autotag/#history)
  - Click on the version to delete and use the "Delete" option if available.

---

**Tip:**
- Have all pages open in browser tabs before starting.
- Delete from Docker Hub first, then from PyPI and TestPyPI to minimize the time users can find old versions.
- Reload the page after each deletion to confirm that the version/tag has disappeared.
