# Issue Tracking & Design System

This directory is the core of task management, issues, and design decisions for the project. We use a **Local-first** and **Documentation-as-Code** approach to ensure that technical context is permanent and processable by AI.

## 📚 Standards and Conventions
To avoid "reinventing the wheel", this system is based on the following industry standards:

1.  **[ADR (Architecture Decision Records)](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions):** We follow Michael Nygard's pattern for recording technical decisions in a numbered and chronological format.
2.  **[RFC (Request for Comments)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs):** We adopt the workflow from projects like Rust or React, where significant changes are proposed and documented before being implemented.
3.  **[Documentation-as-Code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/documentation-as-code/):** We treat documentation with the same rigor as source code (Git versioning, peer review, and Markdown format).

## 🛠 System Structure
Each task or "issue" resides in its own numbered folder (`XXXX-slug`):

- **`index.md`**: The master document of the issue. Contains requirements, tech stack (AWS, AI/ML, C++, Python, etc.) and acceptance criteria.
- **`ai-context.md`**: Critical log of LLM interactions. Here we save prompts and reasoning so that knowledge generated by AI is not lost.
- **`design/`**: Directory for schemas, architecture diagrams (Mermaid/Draw.io) and detailed technical proposals.

## 🚀 Workflow with AI (Copilot/Cursor)
To maintain consistency and avoid duplicate IDs, always use this command with your AI assistant:

> *"Based on the protocol in this directory, create a new issue for [brief description]. Increment the ID based on the last existing one and update the `registry.md`."*

*This system ensures that project knowledge is sovereign, does not depend on external SaaS tools, and is optimized for analysis by language models.*
