**Description:** Major improvement of the statistics and logging system for better traceability and robustness.
### Changed
- Logging and statistics system refactored for robustness and traceability.
- Now both the runtime git describe (from the current repo, if available) and the distributed package git describe (from version.py) are recorded in statistics, making it easier to trace the exact code version used in any environment (including Docker or PyPI installs).
- The statistics file is now written immediately at application startup, ensuring it is always available for monitoring and debugging from the very beginning of each run.
- All code, comments, and log messages are now in English for consistency and maintainability.

## [0.70.7-2-g8b496cb-dirty] - 2026-01-12
**Description:** Work in progress: automating Python package and container generation using GitHub Actions and various improvements. Not final.
### Changed
- Ongoing automation for Python package and container builds (GitHub Actions integration, improvements in packaging and CI/CD workflows).
- Improved documentation in CONTRIBUTING.md and README.md, including an explicit invitation to contribute to the reactivation of CI/CD (GitHub Actions). See or join the discussion on GitHub: https://github.com/txemi/immich-autotag/issues/32
- Preparing a new release to publish these changes and facilitate community collaboration.

## [0.71.0] - 2026-01-14
**Status:** ✅ Published (PyPI & Docker Hub) | ✅ Tested on Jenkins (240K+ assets)
**Description:** GitHub Actions workflow enablement for automated PyPI and Docker Hub publishing.
### Added
- **Automated PyPI publishing via GitHub Actions:** The release workflow now automatically publishes the package to PyPI when a version tag is created.
- **Automated Docker Hub publishing:** Docker images (main and cron variants) are now automatically built and pushed to Docker Hub on release.
- **Immich client version fallback:** The setup script now uses a hardcoded fallback version (v2.4.1) when no Immich server configuration is available, enabling CI/CD environments to work without access to a real Immich server. ([issue](docs/issues/0015-github-actions-pypi-publishing/))

### Changed
- Improved release script workflow to ensure proper version tagging and consistency checking.

### Fixed
- GitHub Actions workflow now works correctly without requiring access to a private Immich server or API credentials. ([GitHub Issue #32](https://github.com/txemi/immich-autotag/issues/32))

## [Next Priority: Full Test Battery & Publishing]
**Status:** 🔄 In Progress
**Type:** Pre-release validation
**Description:** Complete test battery run on 240K+ assets for v0.72.0-rc1 through v0.73.0 before publishing to PyPI and Docker Hub.

### Objective
Run full integration tests on current codebase (feat/album-permission-groups + merged features) to validate:
- Album permission groups Phase 1+2 with large dataset
- Lazy-loading performance with 240K+ assets  
- Auto-album creation and classification stability
- No regressions from v0.71.0

### Blocker
- ⚠️ **Performance regression (issue 0021):** Must investigate and resolve 4h→14-15h slowdown before publication
  - Current hypothesis: album creation frequency, per-asset code changes
  - Root cause identification required before release

### Next steps after validation
1. ✅ Confirm all tests pass on 240K+ asset dataset
2. 🔖 Create v0.72.0 and v0.73.0 final tags (replacing RC tags)
3. 📦 Publish to PyPI and Docker Hub
4. 📢 Announce release with major feature highlights:
   - Album permission groups (enterprise feature)
   - Type system stabilization
   - Performance improvements (pending resolution of regression)

### Tracking
- Link: [issue 0021 — Profiling & Performance Reports](docs/issues/0021-profiling-performance/)
- Current blockers: Performance regression analysis



## [Planned: Compilation Albums Support]
**Description:** Adds support for "compilation" albums that can mix existing and newly added photos (for example, third-party or curated compilations). Classification behavior is relaxed for compilations so assets may belong to multiple albums or match multiple rules, while still providing validation warnings when an asset matches no rule.
### Added
- Support for "compilation" albums that combine existing and new photos, enabling curated or third-party collections.
- Relaxed classification rules for compilation albums: assets may belong to multiple albums or match multiple rule sets to reflect overlapping selections.
- A validation warning is generated when an asset in a compilation does not match any classification rule, helping users identify unclassified items.
### Changed
- Classification engine now supports multi-assignment semantics for assets within compilation albums; scoring and precedence logic adjusted to prefer stronger matches while allowing overlaps.

## [Planned: Profiling & CI Performance Reports]
**Description:** Add CI-integrated profiling and performance reporting so builds produce profiling artifacts and regressions can be detected automatically. See [issue 0021 — Profiling & Performance Reports](docs/issues/0021-profiling-performance/) for the issue details and implementation notes.
### Added
- CI jobs to run representative profiling workloads and archive CPU/memory profiles and flamegraphs.
- Threshold-based regression detection that flags significant slowdowns in representative workloads.
### Changed
- CI pipelines updated to include a small profiling step for representative workloads (configuration and thresholds to be defined in the issue linked above).

## [Planned: Code Quality Improvements (Sonar-like)]
**Description:** Introduce automated static analysis and code-quality gates using SonarQube or similar tools, and apply initial remediation to address the most critical findings.
### Added
- CI job configuration to run static analysis (SonarQube / SonarCloud or equivalent) on pull requests and main branches.
- A baseline report capturing current code quality metrics (bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, coverage trends) to track improvement over time.
- Documentation for developers on how to run local scans and interpret Sonar reports (basic onboarding instructions).
### Changed
- CI pipeline modified to fail or warn builds based on configurable quality gates (e.g., new blocker issues, decreasing coverage, or rapidly rising hotspot counts).
- Project structure and packaging adjusted where necessary to enable more accurate analysis (e.g., excluding generated files, adding source roots for analyzers).
### Fixed / Remediated (initial)
- Addressed a prioritized subset of Sonar-style findings: high-priority security warnings and stability-related code smells reduced through targeted fixes and tests.


## [Planned: Date Correction Improvements]
**Description:** Planned improvements to date correction logic for edge cases and scenarios not currently handled correctly.
### Added
- Enhanced date extraction and correction for problematic or previously unhandled cases.

## [Planned: Album Creation Review]
**Description:** Planned review and overhaul of the automatic album creation system for better accuracy and flexibility.
### Added
- Refactored logic for automatic album creation, improving detection and assignment.

## [Unreleased]
**Description:** Improvements to the rule engine: more abstract, supports not only regex but also simplified common use cases.
### Added

- The internal categorization flow has been adapted to fully leverage the new configuration system introduced in v0.25, enabling more versatile categorizations based on multiple tags and flexible album patterns. ([issue](docs/issues/0009-config-system-refactor/))
- Consolidation of experimental features from version 0.20:
  - Resume processing from the last processed asset (checkpoint resume) is now stable and enabled by default. ([issue](docs/issues/0008-statistics-checkpoint/))
  - Creation and assignment of albums based on folders from the file system library is now stable and enabled by default. ([issue](docs/issues/0004-album-detection/))



## [Planned]
**Description:** Automatic creation of user permissions and user groups based on the rule engine.
### Added
- Automatic assignment of permissions to users according to rules.
- Creation and management of user groups for advanced access control.

## [1.0] - YYYY-MM-DD
### Added
- Robust, uninterrupted processing of large photo sets (tested with 270,000 sample photos). ([issue](docs/issues/0008-statistics-checkpoint/))
- Considered stable and complete for intensive use.
