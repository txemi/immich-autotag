# Roadmap: Immich AutoTag

This document lists upcoming rules, features, and improvements planned for the Immich AutoTag project. Please update this file as new ideas or requirements arise.

## 1. Next Rules to Implement

- **Rule:** Photos with recognized faces should not be tagged as `meme` or `adult meme`.
- **Rule:** Photos belonging to specific groups of albums (e.g., people groups, family trees) should not be tagged as `meme` or `adult meme`. These album groups should be definable by pattern.

## 2. Configuration Improvements

- Allow defining album group patterns (by name, type, or regex) to control classification rules.

## 3. Classification Logic Enhancements

- Improve conflict detection logic for assets classified by multiple criteria.
- Add more granular classification categories as needed.

## 4. Automation and Utilities

- Tool to automatically create albums from folder structures.
- Tool to detect and manage duplicate photos or albums.
- Batch operations for advanced organization workflows using tags.

## 5. Integration Ideas

- Integrate with external AI-based classification systems for enhanced tagging.
- Provide a web interface for managing rules and reviewing classification results.
