# 1. Roadmap: Immich AutoTag

This document lists upcoming rules, features, and improvements planned for the Immich AutoTag project. Please update this file as new ideas or requirements arise.


## 1.1. Next Integrity Rules to Implement

The following are integrity rules, which ensure that the tagging and classification remain consistent and logical. Other types of rules (e.g., automation, enrichment, or workflow rules) may be added in future sections as the project evolves.

2. **Rule:** Photos with recognized faces should belong to an event album.
1. **Rule:** Photos with recognized faces should not be tagged as `meme` or `adult meme`.
3. **Rule:** Photos belonging to specific groups of albums (e.g., people groups, family trees) should not be tagged as `meme` or `adult meme`. These album groups should be definable by pattern.



## 1.2. Automation and Utilities

1. Automatically create albums based on existing regular folder structures (e.g., import folder hierarchies as albums).
2. Assist in the detection and management of duplicate folders or files within the photo library.




## 1.3. Integration Ideas

1. Integrate with external AI-based classification systems for enhanced tagging.
